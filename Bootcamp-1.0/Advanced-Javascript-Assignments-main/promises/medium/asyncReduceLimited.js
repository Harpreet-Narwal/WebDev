// Problem Description – Parallel Chunked Async Reducer

// You are required to process an array using a reducer function where the reduction happens in sequence, but the data fetching or processing for items is performed in parallel chunks. 
// Each chunk should be processed concurrently, then reduced before moving to the next chunk. 
// The final reduced result must be correct and deterministic.
async function asyncReduceLimited(array, limit, asyncProcessFn, reducer, initialValue) {
    let accumulator = initialValue;

    for(let i=0; i<array.length; i+= limit){
        const chunk = array.slice(i, i+limit);

        const processedValue = await Promise.all(
            chunk.map(item=>asyncProcessFn(item))
        );

        for(const value of processedValue){
            accumulator = reducer(accumulator, value);
        }
